# Breast Cancer Prediction  

## Project Objectives  
Use machine learning to predict the benignity or malignancy of breast cancer. Key steps:  
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values)  
2. Feature selection (using correlation analysis)  
3. Training a random forest model (92% accuracy)  

## Quick Start  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
2. Run analysis:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook breast_cancer.ipynb  
   ```  

## Results display  
- AUCå€¼: 0.9953
